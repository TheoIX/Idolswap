IdolSwap (Turtle WoW 1.12)

Auto‑equips the best Druid Idol for the spell or form you are about to cast. It mirrors our Paladin LibramSwap logic 1:1 for a smooth, low‑hitch experience on Turtle WoW’s 1.12 client.

✨ Features

Per‑spell/form idol swapping just‑in‑time, right before the cast.

O(1) bag lookups via a small idol cache ("bag index").

GCD‑aware throttling to reduce micro‑stutters.

Safe‑guarded: Won’t swap while vendor/bank/mail/trade/auction dialogues are open.

Simple toggle: /idolswap to enable/disable.

✅ Requirements

Game: Turtle WoW (1.12‑era UI)

Class: Druid
